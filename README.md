# Guide Repeater
This is a Plugin for [Sketch App](http://www.sketchapp.com) that adds repeating guides to the current artboard.

You can quickly fill the artboard with guides every x pixels, with or without margins. Very useful for grids when you know the width/height of columns and rows.

## Installation
Install this plugin by downloading this repository and double click the `GuideRepeater.sketchplugin` component.

Select the artboard. Go to the plugins menu and select `Guide Repeater -> Generate Guides` or use this keyboard shortcut: `⌘ - ⌥ - G` (cmd+option+g).
A modal will appear where you can define the setup for the guides you aim to create.

## Mentions
I was inspired by [this plugin](https://github.com/herrhelms/even-guides-sketch), but I needed this repeater approach instead. I rewrote part of the code to make it cleaner and easier to understand, so feel free to extend it as you need.

## Enjoy
This is my first Sketch Plugin, but you can hit me up [@zencristi](http://twitter.com/zencristi) for any questions.
